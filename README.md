#Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data ingestion, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, dashboard creation, and business reporting.
The objective is to showcase practical analytics skills used in real-world business environments, from raw data to actionable insights and executive-ready deliverables.

#Dataset
Source: Public / synthetic business dataset
Format: CSV
Description: Contains structured business data used for customer, sales, or operational analysis
Size: Medium-sized dataset suitable for analytics and dashboarding
Key fields include identifiers, categorical attributes, numerical metrics, and time-based columns

#Tools & Technologies
Python: pandas (EDA and data cleaning)
PostgreSQL: SQL querying and analytical transformations
Power BI: Interactive dashboard creation
Gamma: Executive presentation (PPT)
Jupyter Notebook : Development environment

#Project Steps:
1. Data Loading
Imported the dataset into Python using pandas
Performed initial inspection to understand structure, schema, and data types

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed distributions, trends, and outliers
Identified patterns and business-relevant insights
Visualized key metrics using charts and plots

3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values and inconsistencies
Standardized column names and data formats
